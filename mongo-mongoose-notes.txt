Step 1 - Install and Set Up Mongoose

First, require mongoose as mongoose in myApp.js. Next, create a .env file and add a MONGO_URI variable to it. Its value should be your MongoDB Atlas database URI. Be sure to surround the URI with single or double quotes, and remember that you can't use spaces around the = in environment variables. For example, MONGO_URI='VALUE'.

When you are done, connect to the database using the following syntax:

mongoose.connect(<Your URI>, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });



Step 2 - Create a Model

CRUD Part I - CREATE

First of all, we need a Schema. Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection. It defines the shape of the documents within that collection. Schemas are building blocks for Models. They can be nested to create complex models, but in this case, we'll keep things simple. A model allows you to create instances of your objects, called documents.

Replit is a real server, and in real servers, the interactions with the database happen in handler functions. These functions are executed when some event happens (e.g. someone hits an endpoint on your API). Weâ€™ll follow the same approach in these exercises. The done() function is a callback that tells us that we can proceed after completing an asynchronous operation such as inserting, searching, updating, or deleting. It's following the Node convention, and should be called as done(null, data) on success, or done(err) on error.

Warning - When interacting with remote services, errors may occur!

/* Example */

const someFunc = function(done) {
  //... do something (risky) ...
  if (error) return done(error);
  done(null, result);
};

Create a person schema called personSchema having this prototype:

- Person Prototype -
--------------------
name : string [required]
age :  number
favoriteFoods : array of strings (*)

Use the Mongoose basic schema types. If you want you can also add more fields, use simple validators like required or unique, and set default values. See our Mongoose article.

Now, create a model called Person from the personSchema.



Step 3 - Create and Save a Record of a Model

Within the createAndSavePerson function, create a document instance using the Person model constructor you built before. Pass to the constructor an object having the fields name, age, and favoriteFoods. Their types must conform to the ones in the personSchema. Then, call the method document.save() on the returned document instance. Pass to it a callback using the Node convention. This is a common pattern; all the following CRUD methods take a callback function like this as the last argument.

/* Example */

// ...
person.save(function(err, data) {
  //   ...do your stuff here...
});



Step 4 - Create Many Records with model.create()

ometimes you need to create many instances of your models, e.g. when seeding a database with initial data. Model.create() takes an array of objects like [{name: 'John', ...}, {...}, ...] as the first argument, and saves them all in the db.

Modify the createManyPeople function to create many people using Model.create() with the argument arrayOfPeople.



Step 5 - Use model.find() to Search Your database

In its simplest usage, Model.find() accepts a query document (a JSON object) as the first argument, then a callback. It returns an array of matches. It supports an extremely wide range of search options. Read more in the docs.

Modify the findPeopleByName function to find all the people having a given name, using Model.find() -> [Person]

Use the function argument personName as the search key.
